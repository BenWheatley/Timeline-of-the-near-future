Experiment with NotebookLM

Using my own blog post as a starting point: https://benwheatley.github.io/blog/2024/03/23-17.24.34.html

Here's the output:

Voice quality: 99.8% — there were only two glitches that I noticed

How it split up the lines between the characters: 95% — pretty good, but a few lines didn't make sense, should have been assigned to the other

Actual capacity to understand my blog post was: 80% — made a lot of stuff up (it calls it a "report" which is a bit much for a mere few thousand words, I never mentioned quantum computers, I was talking about very early exploration of lunar regolith ISRU), but it was mostly OK

(Based on what I see in internet comments, I kinda get the impression most humans are as bad at understanding each other as this AI was at understanding me; but that's not praise of the AI).
